# WordClock_v2.0

This is a work-in-progress build of a word clock as part [Fab Academy 2015](http://www.fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/fablab/). You can follow the process on [my class website](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/chalmers.iain/index.html). The content is also mirrored to [my GitHub Pages site](http://icchalmers.github.io/).

This clock is an evolution of [WordClock_v1.0](https://github.com/icchalmers/WordClock_v1.0).
